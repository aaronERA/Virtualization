# Virtualization Toolkit

## Introduction

The Virtualization Toolkit is a collection of open source virtualization tools designed to assist cyber security professionals in various security tasks. Virtualization provides a powerful environment for testing, analyzing, and securing systems without impacting production environments. This toolkit offers a range of options to suit different use cases.

## Open Source Virtualization Options

### 1. QEMU

QEMU is a versatile open source virtualization tool capable of emulating a wide range of hardware platforms. It supports both full system and user-mode emulation, making it suitable for various use cases. QEMU provides excellent performance and can be used on multiple host platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
